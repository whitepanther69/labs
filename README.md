# Web Technologies Coursework Specification
### Overview 
The assignment for this module is a single project that is split into two parts. This 
document details both parts. The objective is to demonstrate your understanding 
of client-side web development and mastery of HTML, CSS, & JavaScript. You 
will achieve this by completing a project in which you design, implement, and 
evaluate a statically hosted web site on the topic of fun (essentially build 
something fun). A good place to start might be an online game (story-telling 1
hypertext games are a good way to demonstrate use of web technologies) or a 
secret message coding site (using javascript to encode/decode messages using 
classical codes and ciphers) but you can interpret the topic more broadly if you 
have an idea for something else that is fun (perhaps related to an interest you 
have or pastime that you enjoy).
